This is an open source project that will help a lot of individuals that need to get a car quote calculator on their site. 
We are hoping to achive this in pure java (maybe some php as well).  This is a web-based app. that will give you a price (a quote, an estimated non binding price) for vehicle transportation.  

It will be based on a set amount of money (for example $1 per mile) and will return a price from point A (zipcode) to point B (another zipcode).  

Example
Let's say you need a car transported from Chicago, IL 60634 to Belleville, MI 48111 and the car is an Audi A4.  
The app will calculate the rate/cost of transportation.
* first option/part would be "Origin Point" --> once you enter "60634" the app will show you that it's Chicago, IL.  
* Second part is "Destination Point" --> you enter "48111" and the app will show you that it's Belleville, MI.  
* Third part will be the "Make of a Vehicle" in our example it will be an Audi, once chosen from a drop down menu.
* Fourth part "Model of Vehicle" will have options lik A3, A4, A6, etc... so you will pick "A4" for our example. 
* Fifth part will be the "vehicle condition" the choices will be "running" or "non-running", 
* Sixth part will be the type of transporter required for this, and we will have two choices here (probably buttons on a form) Choices would be "OPEN" or "ENCLOSED"  
* Seventh field will be a button to calculate the quote
Calculator that gives quotes on car shipments throughout the continental USA
